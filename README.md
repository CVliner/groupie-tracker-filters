### Objectives

You must follow the same principles as the first subject.

    Groupie Tracker Filters consists on letting the user filter the artists/bands that will be shown.

    Your project must incorporate at least these four filters:
        filter by creation date
        filter by first album date
        filter by number of members
        filter by locations of concerts

    You must use at least these two types of filters:
        a range filter
        a check box filter

This project will help you learn about:

    Manipulation, display and storage of data
    Event creation and display
    JSON files and format
    Go routines

### Hints

You have to pay attention to the locations. For example Seattle, Washington, USA is part of Washington, USA.
